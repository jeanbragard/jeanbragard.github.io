<h1>Analysis of physiological data</h1>
</center>

I am interested in applying the tools from Statistics and
nonlinear dynamics to the analysis of physiological data (especially in
the context of Biomedical applications). The advent of new experimental
techniques in the field of medicine (like fMRI, NMR, positron
tomography, fluorescence microscopy, etc.) has led to the production of
very large amounts of data with very high quality. The current
challenge is to extract the maximum information from these collections
of data in order to improve diagnostics and to assess the best medical
treatments.<br>

In the figure on the right, you see that the integrated ECG actually
corresponds to the sum of the electrical activity coming from the
different myocytes forming the atria and ventricles. From the point of
view of signal analysis, the ECG gives us incomplete information from
the electrical status of the heart. To infer the complete "real" state
of the heart from the ECG is typically a mathematically "ill-posed"
problem and it requires special handling to be solved. In order to get
better information from the ECG, I use new algorithms that are beyond
the linear tools (Fourier analysis and correlation functions), like
Lyapunov spectrum, signal entropy and fractal dimension (see this
article from a Master student <a href="publi_ref_files/aging_ECG_CINC_2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013</a>
about the influence of ageing in the ECG morphology). Note that MD
cardiologists are trained to solve this difficult problem of inferring
the state of the heart from an examination of the patient's ECG.<br>

      <td style="text-align: justify;">Atrial
fibrillation is the most widespread cardiac disease. It is affecting
elderly people. Different treatments are offered to improve the
patient's condition. One option consists in ablating the portion of the
atrium that is responsible for the onset of fibrillation. This is done
with laser surgery or cryotherapy. During the procedure and using the
same catheter one can extract a very high resolution map of the lectric
state of the atrium (as shown in the right picture). Together with my
colleagues we are extracting the maximum statistical information from
those maps in order to produce useful biomarkers for quantifying the
damage of the atrium. In particular the level of fibrosis is of
paramount importance in order to evaluate the long term prognostic of
the patient. A summary of this research can be found in <a href="publi_ref_files/jce_13972.pdf" target="_blank">2019</a>. Much more work is needed in order to improve those predictions.<br>

this project I am collaborating with the research group of Dr. Blas
