<h1>Control and synchronization of spatially extended chaotic
systems</h1>
</center>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>When studying coupled dynamical
systems, it ofentimes happens that if the coupling is strong enough and
adequately choosen the different units forming the whole system get
into synchronized motion. Synchronization is seen as a universal
feature of coupled dynamical systems and it is currently subject to
many studies.<br>

<td style="text-align: justify;">The first scientific account of the
synchronized motion is due to the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huyghens.
In 1665, the physicist lay ill in bed, watching the motions of two
pendulum clocks he had built.<br>To his surprise, he detected an &#8220;odd
kind of sympathy&#8221; between the clocks: regardless of their initial
state, the two pendulums soon adopted the same rhythm, one moving left
as the other swung right.<br>Elated, Huygens announced his finding at a
special session of the Royal Society of London, attributing this
synchrony to tiny forces transmitted between the clocks by the wooden
beam from which they were suspended.<br>In 1960s, Arthur Winfree, a
theoretical biologist began to study coupled oscillators occurring in
Biological systems. Since then the interest in the study of
synchronization has not decayed.<br></td>

<p>  I am interested in the synchronization features observed in the
case of spatially extended dynamical systems (i.e. modelled by partial
differential equations). For
this project I often collaborate&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dr. Stefano Boccaletti.
Current interests&nbsp;lay in the analysis of synchronization in
complex networks.</p>

<h2 align="left">Asymmetric coupling of dynamical systems</h2>
<p align="left">The coupling of two identical chaotic systems can lead to very interesting and surprising phenomenon. One of which is called chaos suppression. It can be detected by monitoring the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the coupled system. It is illustrated in the figures below for the particular case of two coupled chaotic Lotka-Volterra systems (Prey-Predator system). More details of this study can be found in this publication of Chaos <strong>17(4)</strong>,  (<a href="http://fisica.unav.es/~jbragard/publi_ref_files/Chaos_17_043107.pdf">2007</a>).</p>
